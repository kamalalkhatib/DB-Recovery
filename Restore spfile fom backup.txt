If we lost an spfile file and we have a backup of it, we can restore it from this backup.
These are the required steps to restore the SPFILE from the backup:
RMAN> startup force nomount 
MAN> restore spfile from '/fra/NCSCM/autobackup/2018_05_10/o1_mf_s_975750557_fh8mgxv7_.bkp';

Starting restore at 10-MAY-18
using channel ORA_DISK_1

channel ORA_DISK_1: restoring spfile from AUTOBACKUP /fra/NCSCM/autobackup/2018_05_10/o1_mf_s_975750557_fh8mgxv7_.bkp
channel ORA_DISK_1: SPFILE restore from AUTOBACKUP complete
Finished restore at 10-MAY-18
